This memory palace takes place in my boyfriend's parents' house. They live in Pittsburgh so this is a place that is close to me physically and emotionally.
Thier house is very homely because his mother keeps it clean and smelling like lavender. In this memory palace, there are things to reminded me about items and actions that calm me down. It can be hard to remember what they are during stressful times so going to there mentally will help.
