# Memory Palace

Microsoft Bob's aesthetic reminded me of Martha Stewart, TV lifestyle personality. I thought I'd make a space that I would have to clean, as Martha Stewart might. So I wrote some functions that allowed me to do this in terminal. They can be found in the file [functions.sh](https://github.com/everestpipkin/datagardens/tree/master/students/christianbroms/1_memoryPalace/functions.sh). 

For each room, there's something I have to clean, and how it looks in ASCII reminds me how often I have to clean it. For example, three pieces of cutlery = polish silver every three months. I navigate the house by "entering" and "leaving" each "room", which are bash functions.
