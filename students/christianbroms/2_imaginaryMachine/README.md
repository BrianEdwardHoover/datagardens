# Image Classifier Outputs

I decided to fake the output of an image classifier that's been fed images that aren't so representative of the images that usually used to train image classifiers. I also created some of the descriptions of the images that are representative of what might be created by workers on Mechanical Turk. The slides with the input images and outputs can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tb0YxjyLF1ANXZUBxfQ0UyLeuwAaWv0XNpyWERtPGRs/edit?usp=sharing).
