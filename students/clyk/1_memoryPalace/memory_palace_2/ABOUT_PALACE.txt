The architecture of this palace is roughly based on my childhood home and the places I would go hide for hide-and-seek. Each hiding place is helping me memorize the layers of the ocean (sunlight, twilight, midnight, abyss, trenches), the approximate depth (in feet) of each layer, and AT LEAST (there may be more clues) 1 sea creature that lives in that area.
