# imaginary machine

For my project, I spent a lot of time trying to brainstorm things that bots could do. But then, I realized a perhaps an equally interesting question would be "what can't bots do?"

Then I realized! Bots can't solve CAPTCHAs (or, at least, we hope they can't)!

So for my project, I pretended to be a simple account-making bot, and then practiced failing at CAPTCHAs. It's an especially intersting question for me, because I've looked at, used and made some simple machine learning classifiers before, so thinking of CAPTCHAs as something bots still can't do is facinsating to me. What is it that separates humans and AI? CAPTCHA makers have to investigate this question and leverage the results of their research. 

There's already been a movement away from the traditional warped-text CAPTCHA towards a simple checkbox that (I learned this from Everest) works by watching your mouse behavior. I believe that although they can't do them YET, but bots will most likely be able to solve this current generation of CAPTCHAs eventually. Then, companies will have to make new CAPTCHAs that further reinforce the divide between human and bot.
