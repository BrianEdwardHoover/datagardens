For this project i wrote a captains log. I wrote it to sound like an ai trained on explorers logs wrote it.


This day they began the ascent. The following day was spent in cutting a small run of good soil, and thence proceed
 in as nearly a west direction as the last. The stones at the head of a sugar-loaf. In the beginning of the party 
proceeded from the island, these flowers which much incommoded the horses and provisions, they were baffled in every instance.


This day they proceeded about three miles and a-half in a south westerly direction, through forest land beyond it,
 reckoning the descent of the wombat, C Wentworth Esqs.They were enabled to pass. These flowers, which they supposed 
to be seen, and Lieutenant Lawson. They were getting into miserable condition.


For this writing my goal was to make it ai sound like it used n-grams as I have experience with n-grams and know generally 
how they work and sound. I tried to make the sentences run on for quite a bit and the text only make sense in small snippets.
 I also tried to repeat some words/phrases/topics as an ai trained on a smaller data set would.
