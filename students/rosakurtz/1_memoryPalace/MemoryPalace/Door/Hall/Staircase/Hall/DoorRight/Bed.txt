The bed is an iron-posted queen that stands in the center stage. The quilt's fabric has been torn to shreds in nearly every spot, but the blue fabric is clean and soft. You could  probably squeeze yourself into the space under the bed, with the dust bunnies and spiders but it's the first place anyone would look for you.
