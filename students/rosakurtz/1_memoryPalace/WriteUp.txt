I didn't choose to try and memorize a fact, because I do that regularly for my other classes and I've always preferred just simple memorization. That and I have a terrible sense of direction so am more likely to get lost than successfully memorize a fact. 

Instead I found this assignment useful in helping me create a 3d space (keeping the bad sense of direction in check), I could see myself using this in the future to help plan game storylines or structure because it is so quick to edit and add detail while keeping yourself honest about where rooms and objects are in a way writing down details is not (I.e if you left the hairbrush text file in the bedroom there is no way you will accidentally find it in the living room unless you actually move the file).

I tried to incorporate the memory of feeling into my memory palace, and in particular what I remember of my first house and living at age six, focusing on how I loved hide and seek. Unlike facts, I've always struggled with remembering what I felt like (I think this is pretty common) so I wanted to try and record them using this tool. 

I also pulled on my creative writing experience (limited and amateur, but pleasurable) because along with art it's always been the best way to get a sense of who I used to be, so I thought it would be a better medium to fill my folders with then downloaded images.
